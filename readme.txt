<Description>
This repository contains terminal-interface connect four and deep learning model. 
All the code is written in Python with some popular libraries such as numpy.
The deep-learning model is designed using TensorFlow. It uses Q-learning and by playing itself to improve its ability.

<How AI model works>
The model consists of 1 Convolutional layer and 4 fully connected layers.
With my limited experience in 
It takes an input of the board state and output value for each action player can take.
